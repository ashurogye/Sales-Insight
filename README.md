# Sales-Insight
This is sales insight of Altiq Hardware using Power BI
In this Power BI project few steps were involved before vizualization

STEP 1 : PULLING DATA FROM THE DATABASE
The data was in the repository of the hardware company so the data was extracted using mySQL.

STEP 2: TRANSFORMATION AND CLEANING
The data had lot of missing values as well as currency which needed to be transformed. Hence 
with the use of power BI, I transformed the data.

STEP 3: DASHBOARD
I generated a dashboard displaying the revenue by city and how many products are being consumed in different city.
Relations were made in the tables using POWER BI.
